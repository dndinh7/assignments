= Hardware specifications

Where did your run your tests? A laptop, or goldengate?

I ran my tests on my laptop on WSL.

What are the performance specifications of the machine: number and speed of
processors, size of RAM? (use `lscpu` and `free -m`)

I have 8 CPUs and the speed of the processors is 1991.999 MHz. I have 12.0 GB of ram,
with 9432 MB of memory and 3072 MB of swap memory.
