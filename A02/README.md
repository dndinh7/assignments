Assumptions and Design:

For Entwise:

I assume that the user enters a nonempty string (not a newline)



For Dynamic Restaurants:

I assume that the user enters a string that fits into a 32 char buffer. I also 
assume that the user will input valid times (24 hour clock) for opening and closing times.
I assume that they input a valid rating (0 to 5) for the restaurant as well. 
If the user inputs wrong values, then there will be undefined behaviors.



For 2048:

The result will be the maximum number that RESULTS from a shift. If there is no
shift the results in combining pairs, then the program will return the largest
number on the grid.
